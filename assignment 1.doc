                                              ASSIGNMENT 1

1)String Functions in JavaScript:

i)length: Returns the length of a string.
  let str = "Hello, World!";
  console.log(str.length);
 Output: 13

ii)charAt(index): Returns the character at the specified index in a string.
 let str = "Hello";
 console.log(str.charAt(1));
 Output: e

iii)concat(str1, str2, ...): Combines two or more strings.
 let str1 = "Hello";
 let str2 = "World";
 let result = str1.concat(", ", str2, "!");
 console.log(result);
 Output: Hello, World!

iv)indexOf(substring, startIndex): Returns the index of the first occurrence of a substring, starting from the specified      index.
let str = "Hello, World!";
console.log(str.indexOf("World")); 
 Output: 7


2) Print the numbers from the increasing order using a for loop in java script.

for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    for (let j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
        process.stdout.write(j + " ");
    }
    console.log();
}
OUTPUT:
1 
1 2 
1 2 3 
1 2 3 4 
1 2 3 4 5 

EXPLANATION:
 
 Outer Loop (for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++)):

The outer loop is responsible for iterating over the rows of the pattern.
It starts with i equal to 1 and continues as long as i is less than or equal to 5.
In each iteration, the value of i increases by 1.
Inner Loop (for (let j = 1; j <= i; j++)):

The inner loop is responsible for iterating over the columns within each row.
It starts with j equal to 1 and continues as long as j is less than or equal to the current value of i.
In each iteration, the value of j increases by 1.
Print Numbers (process.stdout.write(j + " ");):

Within the inner loop, the statement process.stdout.write(j + " "); prints the current value of j followed by a space.
This prints the numbers in each row separated by spaces without moving to the next line.
Move to the Next Line (console.log();):

After completing the inner loop for a particular row (i), console.log(); is used to move to the next line.
This ensures that the numbers for the next row will be printed on a new line.
Repeat (for loops):

The outer loop continues to the next iteration, and the process repeats until the outer loop condition is no longer true (when i exceeds 5).



3) Write a code in javaScript  to find the perimeter of a trinagle.

CODING:

function calculateTrianglePerimeter(side1, side2, side3) {

    if (side1 <= 0 || side2 <= 0 || side3 <= 0) {
        return "Invalid input: All side lengths must be positive.";
    }
    let perimeter = side1 + side2 + side3;

    return perimeter;
}

Example usage:
let side1 = 3;
let side2 = 4;
let side3 = 5;

let perimeter = calculateTrianglePerimeter(side1, side2, side3);
console.log("Perimeter of the triangle:", perimeter);

  

EXPLANATION:
 
The calculateTrianglePerimeter function takes three parameters (side1, side2, and side3) representing the lengths of the sides of a triangle.
It checks whether the input sides are valid for a triangle, and if not, it returns an error message.
It calculates the perimeter by adding the lengths of the three sides.
The example usage section demonstrates how to use the function by providing specific side lengths, calling the function, and printing the result to the console.

   
4)Write a javaScript code to count the no. of vowels in a string.

CODING:
 
 function countVowels(inputString) {
    let lowercaseString = inputString.toLowerCase();
    const vowels = new Set(['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']);
    let vowelCount = 0;
    for (let char of lowercaseString) {
        if (vowels.has(char)) {
            vowelCount++;
        }
    }
    return vowelCount;
}
let inputString = "Hello, World!";
let result = countVowels(inputString);
console.log("Number of vowels:", result);

INPUT:           OUTPUT:
dhakshana         3
